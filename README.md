# Classifiers-Performance-Test
We tested the performance of the following classifiers:
1. Logistic Regression 
2. Random Forest Classifier 
3. Support Vector Classifier
4 A soft voting classifier that combines the above three.

We load the digits dataset using the function load digits in sklearn and split it into training
and test sets using train test split. Train the following classifiers
using the training set and compare their performance on the test set
